### Future Improvements

Change to a custom glTF to binary import format for Blender files. Preprocess glTF into Your Own Format.

: 2–10× faster depending on how much animation, mesh, and material data you strip/pack.






Tracing Terrain Creation and Randomness ffs ugh

-[TestLevel_Terrain.js]
    const terrain2 = await buildTerrain(gl);

-buildTerrain(gl) [terrain.js] (creates chunks)
    const newMesh = 
    await createTerrainMesh(gl, CHUNK_SIZE, worldOffsetX, worldOffsetZ);
    const terrainChunk = new Entity(
        {
            mesh: newMesh,
            position: [worldOffsetX, 0, worldOffsetZ],
            shader: myShaders.Lighting,
            texture: texture,
            id: `terrain_chunk_${x},${z}`,
        });
-createTerrainMesh [meshShapes.js] 
(returns "terrainInfo" to create mesh for entity chunk)
    generateFlatGridAsync()

-generateFlatGridAsync [terrain.js]
    worker_flatGrid

-[workerFlatGrid.js] (gets height and biome values)

















NEW CHANGE:

new way to create a shape. Create it as an Entity, which takes a new mesh as its constructor. Ex:

const triangle = new Entity(createTriangle(gl, 1), [0,0,0]);

When creating a new shape, you also have to put it in the draw() method of main or it won't appear



Mesh Shapes defines shapes, like Cube
Scene creates new Entity(mesh=createCube // from Mesh Shapesz)
mesh calculates AABB, but holds it, since it's only local
Entity then takes that AABB and converts it to world space. THATS where the collider comes from
AABB never changes, since the model never changes, but the worldAABB does. so that's the collider.

# 3DGameEngineJS



## Main.js

Holds ref to gl. 

const myShaders -- a list of shaders from Shaders.js. Access like <code> myShaders.SolidColor </code>

Render loop.

Update loop.




## Controls.js

Keybindings.

Also exports the movement vector based on player input.



## Camera.js

Set vars for: follow distance, pitch, yaw, zoom, etc

Has a "follow target", which defaults to the player (set in main).





## Player.js

Sets its initial Y position to half-height so it's not centered in the floor.

Player Update() is vector math based on "Forward Vector" and "Right Vector" imported from camera.js

Player Draw() is 


## MeshShapes.js

Mesh class. Handles indentity matrix, and buffers for shapes. position, uv, normals, etc. 
Includes helper functions to scale, rotate, etc.
Includes <code>Mesh.draw(shader)</code>

Shape factory. Defines vertex matrices of shapes, which defines positions, uvs, and normals.

Includes LoadTexture function

Includes LoadModel function, which imports JSON that was exported from Blender



## Shaders.js

All actual shader code. Stored in <code>const: shaders<code> 

Has Shader Class. Includes building shader program, tracking shader vars, etc

CreateShaders(gl) -- Passes an object of shader programs to Main.js. 
Access in main with <code> myShaders.SolidColor </code>



## Debug.js

Runs Debug Gridlines and Origin Raycast



## Blender

Paste the following code in the "Scripting" tab inside Blender. Tested with version 4.4.3

This will export the model's vertecies into a JSON file in the same directory as the .blend file.

<code>

import bpy
import bmesh
import json
import os

obj = bpy.context.active_object
mesh = obj.data

# Ensure mesh is triangulated
bm = bmesh.new()
bm.from_mesh(mesh)
bmesh.ops.triangulate(bm, faces=bm.faces[:])  # Triangulate in-place
bm.verts.ensure_lookup_table()

vertices = []
for face in bm.faces:
    for loop in face.loops:
        vert = loop.vert
        
        #normal = loop.vert.normal      # auto-smooths
        normal = face.normal            # no smoothing
        
        uv_layer = bm.loops.layers.uv.active
        uv = loop[uv_layer].uv if mesh.uv_layers.active else (0.0, 0.0)

        # Transform Blender coords [x, y, z] → WebGL coords [x, z, -y]
        co = vert.co
        x, y, z = co.x, co.y, co.z
        nx, ny, nz = normal.x, normal.y, normal.z

        vertex = {
            "position": [x, z, -y],
            "normal":   [nx, nz, -ny],
            "uv":       [uv.x, 1 - uv.y],  # Flip V to match WebGL
        }
        vertices.append(vertex)

bm.free()

output_path = os.path.join(bpy.path.abspath("//"), "model_export.json")
with open(output_path, "w") as f:
    json.dump(vertices, f, indent=2)

print("Exported to", output_path)
